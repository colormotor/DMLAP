Each one of these units represents a prediction of how likely the network predicts the input digit as being that class. We use the class with the highest confidence as the prediction from the model. \n",

    "- We can use different kernel sizes when we perform convolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The size of the kernel will determine how big the patterns are that we can detect with our convolution operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A deep CNN has convolutional layers stacked on top of each other. Each layer is made up of lots of different feature extractors, responding to different kinds of patterns. The output(s) of one layer becomes the input(s) to the next one.\n",

    "- Max-pooling is used to downsample the output information from one convolutional layer to the next one (by dividing the output matrix into windows and taking the maximum value in the window).\n",

    "- Flattening is converting the data into a 1-dimensional array for inputting it to the next layer. We flatten the output of the convolutional layers to create a single long feature vector.\n",

    "- The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of rate at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",

Using a higher batch size generally leads to better results training, as the weights are updated based on the loss of the whole batch, which leads to more stable training than if we were to update the weights after each single example.
